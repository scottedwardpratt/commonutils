Common Utilities 
Authors: Scott Pratt
A grab bag of short codes used in other projects. These include codes to do things like Lorentz tranformations. No effort is made to document any of the codes. To compile the libraries, go to the software directory, then enter
.../commonutils/softare% cmake .
.../commonutils/softare% make
